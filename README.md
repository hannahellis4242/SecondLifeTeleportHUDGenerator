# SecondLifeTeleportHUDGenerator

A code generator to quickly create the lsl script for a teleport hud.

## How to use

This is a command line tool that takes in a json file that describes how
your hud is layed out and the actions that should be peformed. The generator
converts this into lsl code that will perform the actions in the json file, and
will save it to the spesified output file. You can then import this into second
life to make your teleport hud work.
